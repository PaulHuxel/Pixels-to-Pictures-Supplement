# Pixels to Pictures Supplemental Material
"[Pixels to Pictures](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/courseware/pixels-to-pictures.html)" is free courseware authored by MathWorks to help teach students "the basics of programming while they edit images, build GIFs, and create color filters and face masks that are applied in popular apps."  Recommended Ages: 10+

This repository provides additional MATLAB live scripts to supplement the Pixels to Pictures courseware.  The [Courseware Overview](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/academia/highschool/courseware/pixels-to-pictures/Syllabus.pdf) is broken down into 5 days.  I teach this material through CoderDojo over the course of 10 lessons (roughly half a "day" per lesson).  As such, the supplemental scripts refer to these lesson numbers instead of the Course Overview day numbers.

Short walkthrough videos for the first five lessons can be found on my [CoderDojo MATLAB YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoRboOyME_RU3JDIk-qSmKbOcy-YXWiCp).
